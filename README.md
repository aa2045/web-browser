# web-browser
web browser using C#
The project aims to create a simple web browser in WinForms. The application receives the HTTP 
response messages of the requested web address and displays the status code, status description, and 
response messages. The web browser manages a list of previously browsed URLs (History), whose 
response messages are loaded by the mere clicking of the URL in history. Web Browser maintains 
Favorites whose contents are URLs and names associated with it. The user can Add, Delete, and Modify 
the URLs in favorites.
The Web Browser application was developed in Visual Studio for C#, 2019 community edition using the 
.NET Framework with WinForms user interface.
